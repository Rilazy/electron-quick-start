# Riley's DnD Assistant

I abandoned this project a while ago. I may revisit the idea, but the code should be thrown out, I was a very bad programmer back then. I'm archiving instead of deleting it
because of it's sentimental and self-deprecating joke value.

**A DnD Assistant that I'll make a README file for once I actually have figured out what all specifically it does**
